# ClouDNS DNS01 Client

This was basically taken straight out of [lego](https://github.com/go-acme/lego).

It has been modified to not alter the domain and value of the record to be presented, to make it work with cert-manager.

Additional modifications have been made by @Gapodo to remove most of the old dependencies.

The original source (version copied) can be found [here](https://github.com/go-acme/lego/tree/8edce3b2cfa77b0a0481aa92540589a4d08ab966/providers/dns/cloudns).
